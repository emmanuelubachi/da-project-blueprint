## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this Next.js project starter in Visual Studio Code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)**: Next.js relies on Node.js. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), which includes npm.

   To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open your terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v

   ```

2. **Visual Studio Code**: You can download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from [code.visualstudio.com](code.visualstudio.com). It's a lightweight, highly customizable code editor with excellent support for JavaScript and React development.

After installing VS Code, you might want to consider installing some useful extensions for web development, such as **"ESLint"** for code linting and **"Prettier"** for code formatting. You can install extensions from the VS Code marketplace.
